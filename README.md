# Hi, I'm Afsaneh! but you can call me "Afi"   
**Aspiring Data Analyst & Storyteller| Python â€¢ SQL â€¢ Power BI â€¢ Data Storytelling**

My name means *legendary tales and fiction*, and I believe data has stories just as powerfulâ€”if we learn how to listen.  
As a data analyst, Iâ€™m passionate about uncovering meaningful patterns, crafting insights, and telling the *true* stories behind the numbers.

Whether itâ€™s a dashboard, a dataset, or a discovery, I see data as a bridge between facts and imaginationâ€”between the seen and the unseen.

ðŸ“š Currently building my portfolio and turning raw data into stories that speak.
